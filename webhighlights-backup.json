It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred — a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later. You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.","id":"f74b2e0f-2b3e-4a16-a623-8c462c6b46f4","__isHighlightSource":{}},"domElementOffsetTop":1658,"domElementOffsetLeft":0,"title":"Composing suspending functions | Kotlin Documentation","_bookmark":"67979c84559f4e1edaec6383","_id":"67979c84559f4e1edaec6382","_objectStore":"marks"},{"createdAt":1737989642395,"updatedAt":0,"url":"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html#your-first-coroutine","tags":[],"text":"The name of runBlocking means that the thread that runs it (in this case — the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call, until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution","type":"normal","completeText":"The name of runBlocking means that the thread that runs it (in this case — the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call, until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution.

Basically groups at MIT identify a topic and then advertise (through the institutions networks) the opportunity for others to participate. Participation requires a significant fee, but the fee is only a part of the consortium's overall funding and that means that you are buying into a research program that is many times larger than you could fund independently. The consortium then offers a range of ways for members to participate including workshops, courses, meetups, placements","id":"8cac997b-ea5b-4c81-828f-68b21103e975","__isHighlightSource":{}},"domElementOffsetTop":2003,"domElementOffsetLeft":179,"title":"How not to build an AI Institute - by Alex Chalmers","_bookmark":"67ea9cfc3fd409fae95e611f","_id":"67eaa8e09b98e15909406b72","_objectStore":"marks"},{"createdAt":1743431929554,"updatedAt":0,"url":"https://www.chalmermagne.com/p/how-not-to-build-an-ai-institute","tags":[],"text":"The blinding miss is that I think that the startup community in London could have benefited significantly from the ATI facilitating and developing their work - but I am not a startup guy ","type":"normal","completeText":"The blinding miss is that I think that the startup community in London could have benefited significantly from the ATI facilitating and developing their work - but I am not a startup guy so didn't explore that.
