# Dave's dot files


Note that the repository contains submodules so must be cloned recursively.
Also contains the iterm LiquidCarbon theme I like for terminal. 
install.sh works for Mac and Linux 

```sh
git clone --recursive  https://github.com/davidmeredith/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh

or 
sudo ./install.sh
```

**⚠️  WARNING! ⚠️**- This will overwrite existing config files without saving them. _Use at your own risk!_
